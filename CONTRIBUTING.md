# Contributing to this repo

Please take some time and look below at each section to make your contribution and implementation easy and as fast as possible.

## Utilizing the Github Issue Tracker

The issue tracking should only be used for the following purposes:

* Bug Reports
* Feature Requests
* Submissions for Pull Requests

Please **do not** use the issue tracker for the following:

* Personal support issues (ie: certain feature won't work on my local hosted instance)
* * Please redirect these issues to a relevant Stack channel

* Purposeful trolling or discussion derailment

## Reporting Bugs

A `bug` is defined as an unexpected or incorrect output compared to what is expected from the input.

Submitting a bug report should be extremely specific, describing every step involved in recreating it.

Please follow the steps below for reporting and identifying a bug:

1. **Search for any similar issues** &mdash; If the bug has been reported in the past it is possible you can find an updated discussion or solutions to it.

2. **Determine if the issue has already been fixed** &mdash; Try building or utilizing the most recent development version in an attempt to determine if the bug has already been identified and fixed.

If you cannot find any other mention of the bug, you're in the position in which you need to create a bug report.

Writing a proper bug report should not require others to ask for more information. Please try and include as much relevant information as possible within your bug report.

Example:

> Short and descriptive title
>
> A summary of the issue and all information regarding the environment(OS/Browser).
>
> A list of steps to recreate the bug.
>
> Any other information deemed useful or possibly relevant.

*Please remember to label your issue as a bug report.*

## Feature Requests

Feature requests do not have a format or specific guidelines to follow. We ask that any or all feature requests describe the feature in as much detail as possible describing the impacts of the feature.
